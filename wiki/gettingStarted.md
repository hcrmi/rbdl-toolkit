## Useful functions

The `F5` command in Toolkit reloads all the models, so you can make modifications and quickly see the results instead of needing to reopen the software. 

The joint axes local frame can be enabled by modifying `Settings > frame_axis.size and frame_axis.diameter`. 
Additional settings can be found in [Settings](settings.md)
